the choice of activation function depends on the problem and network architecture. 
The tasks related to both linear and nonlinear activation functions in neural networks:


Task	                                                              Activation Function                                                    	Description
Linear Regression	                                                  Identity (Linear)	                         Predicting continuous values (e.g., house prices, temperature) based on input features.
Binary Classification	                                              Sigmoid (Nonlinear)	                       Determining whether an input belongs to one of two classes (e.g., spam or not spam).
Image Classification      	                                        ReLU (Linear)	                             Assigning labels to images (e.g., cat, dog, car) from pixel values.
Sentiment Analysis	                                                Tanh (Nonlinear)	                         Analyzing text sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).
Stock Price Prediction	                                            Identity (Linear)	                         Forecasting stock prices based on historical data.
Multiclass Classification	                                          Softmax (Nonlinear)	                       Assigning multiple labels to an input (e.g., handwritten digit recognition).
Text Categorization	                                                Linear SVM (Linear)	                       Classifying news articles into topics (e.g., sports, politics).
Object Detection	                                                  Leaky ReLU (Nonlinear)	                   Identifying objects in images (e.g., bounding boxes around cars).
Simple Logical Operations	                                          Step Function (Linear)	                   AND, OR, XOR operations using a single-layer perceptron.
Natural Language Processing	                                        GRU (Nonlinear)	                           Modeling sequential data (e.g., language translation, chatbots).
